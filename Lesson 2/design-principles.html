                            The <b>Rule of Thirds</b> is one of the fundanental rules of compositons in design. 
                            As web developers, we learned and used the Rule of Thirds because it is one of the design principles for a website. 
                            It is a layout or grid of nine equal boxes to overlay an image, web page, or painting to make them unique. Just imagine two parallel lines on the 
                            layout of a webpage going across horizontally and another two parallel lines going vertically down, overing 
                            lapping the two other parallels. On a web page, we have a grid to use the Rule of Thirds to layout
                            the design of our web pages. The reason why web developers uses this rule is to make their websites and web pages present well everyone. For example, 
                            Delta, an airline company, used the Rule of Thirds well on their website. The screenshot that I took showed some images of people relaxing or enjoying their vacation. Delta used the
                            Rule of Thirds to make that image fasinating and peaceful for us to enjoy not only the picture, but the website.

                            <b>White Space and Clean Design</b> is one the compositions of the design principles for designing a webpage. It is space between layouts, lines in paragraphs,
                            headings, and other elements in a web page. So, why does it matter? Well, it matters because it helps to transform a web page to look great for companies to customers.
                            It helps customers too to view your web page. What I mean by this statement is it helps the customers to view items on your web page better. Create breathing spaces for customers, design the brandings
                            and tones better, and use focus and attention. For example, Apple, an American technology company, have their website with perfect white spaces and a clean design.
                            The images of iPhones, headings, and text are perfect design and easy to view and scroll through. It is perfect and enjoyable to go through.

                            <b>Contrast</b> is one of the compositions of the design principles for designing a webpage. It makes design elements look different from the other design elements.
                            In contrast, there are color factors, size factors, space factors, and style factors. The color factors helps with contrast by constrasting the colors, seperating lights from dark 
                            or dark from lights. A popular example is a black element on a white background. Size factors contrast and help creating relationships between elements. It will help the customer to know 
                            what to look at or what element is the most important to read. Space factors helps to contrast organize design elements. It helps the customer to have more attention towards the element, when it has 
                            spacing in between the elements. Finally, style factors helps to make elements notable in their own styles. It helps the customer to see the difference between the elements shape or size.
                            An example of a website that has good contrast is Samsung. In the screenshot, you can tell it has perfect contrast due to their color, size, spacing, and style.
